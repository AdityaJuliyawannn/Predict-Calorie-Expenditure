# Predict Calorie Expenditure ðŸ¤µ

This repository contains our solution for the Kaggle competition: **Playground Series - Season 5, Episode 5 (S5E5)**, where the goal is to predict **calorie expenditure** based on various physiological and biometric features.

## Background ðŸ§ 

In an era where fitness and health monitoring have become increasingly digitized, estimating calorie expenditure accurately is critical. Whether it's for wearables, health tracking apps, or personal fitness goals, having a model that can predict how much energy is burned during physical activities can help users and systems make better health decisions.
This challenge provides a rich dataset simulating real-world biometric and physical activity data. The goal is to build a regression model that predicts the amount of calories burned during an exercise session, based on personal and session-related features.

## Objective ðŸŽ¯

Develop and evaluate machine learning models that predict the number of calories expended during physical activity.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of:

- `train.csv`: Training data with 7500+ observations.
- `test.csv`: Test data without the target column.
- `sample_submission.csv`: Template for predictions.

### ðŸ“Š Features:

- `age`: Age of the individual (years)
- `height`: Height (cm)
- `weight`: Weight (kg)
- `duration`: Duration of exercise (minutes)
- `heart_rate`: Average heart rate during the session
- `body_temp`: Average body temperature (Celsius)

### ðŸŽ¯ Target:
- `calories`: Total energy expenditure during the exercise session (kcal)

## ðŸ§ª Approach

1. **EDA & Preprocessing**
   - Checked for null values, distributions, correlations, and outliers.
   - Normalized features where appropriate.
   - Explored log transforms and feature interactions.

2. **Model Training**
   - Tried multiple regression models:
     - Linear Regression
     - Random Forest Regressor
     - Gradient Boosting Regressor
     - XGBoost Regressor
     - CatBoost Regressor
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and Optuna

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE) â€“ Primary metric for Kaggle leaderboard.
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - RÂ² Score
